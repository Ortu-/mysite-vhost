<p>Welcome! 

<p>I am Josh and this is stuff I work on, think about, and am interested in, involving all manner of code and software development. I have tried out and worked with many languages over the years, have grown experienced in a handful, and I am always interested in learning something new.

<p>So first off, let's talk about this blog itself. Aside from providing a platform for discussion, it was started as something of a learning experience when I began digging into <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> with <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>. This is server side javascript, and I will have to say that javascript is easily one of my favorite languages. It can do so much more than manipulate front end UIs. Speaking of the front end, it is built on <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. The source for the whole thing can of course be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/ortu-/blog" target="_blank">github</a>.

<p>Well, why not just use WordPress like everyone else? It's a blog right? Sure, I could, but where is the fun in that? I am a big DIY type of person. That doesn't mean I want to code every line from the ground up, I love using good tools and components that other's have made. It's when you start getting into complete, boxed-up packages that I start to go ehh... let's see what I can come up with instead. Even if you happen to fail and fall back to a premade solution, you will still have learned something in the attempt.

<p>Ok great, so why black and orange? I chose the amber because it reminds me of an earlier time, back in the dark days of monochrome monitors. People often think of the green screen consoles when they think of the monitors from this time period, but there were also monochrome amber screens and this is what I had. When I think of my early involvement with computers, it is the black and amber that always comes to mind. Did you know that you can recreate these old green and amber consoles in the cmd prompt? Right click the title bar and hit properties.

<p>Anyway, stick around, discuss, enjoy, and I hope you find some interesting and useful content within my musings.
