<p>Welcome! 

<p>I am Josh and this is stuff I work on, think about, and am interested in, involving all manner of code and software development. I have tried out and worked with many languages over the years, have grown experienced in a handful, and I am always interested in learning something new.

<p>So first off, let's talk about this blog itself. I built this site using <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a>, managed by the <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">express framework</a>, and using the <a href="http://jade-lang.com/" target="_blank">jade templating engine</a>. This is server side javascript, and I will have to say that javascript is easily one of my favorite languages, it can do so much more than make slick front end UIs. The source for the whole thing can of course be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/ortu-/blog" target="_blank">github</a>.

<p>The front-end is built on <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a> by default, but I've put together an alternate version using <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> found <a href="http://jcode.joshkirklin.com/blog/introduction" target="_blank">over here</a>.

<p>So now you are thinking "Wait, what? Node, Angular ok looking good, looking modern. What's with the jQuery?" Well, whether you have made the switch or not, jQuery is still quite prevalent and will likely continue to have wide-spread use for some time. It is good to have a mastery over both the old and the new. I find it valuable to be able to work even with bare-bones vanilla javascript from time to time. 

<p>Now of course in a "regular" production environment, there is no need to mix the two, and few reasons to do so. On a jQuery project, use jQuery, on another project use Angular, or Ember or whatever framework it is decided that the project will be built upon, based on that project's needs. That being said, the best way to keep a skillset strong is to keep using it from time to time.

<p>Well, why not just use WordPress like everyone else? It's just a blog right? Sure, I could, but where is the fun in that? I am a big DIY type of person. That doesn't mean I want to code every line from the ground up, I love using good tools and components that other's have made. It's when you start getting into complete packages that I start to go ehh... let's see what I can come up with instead. Even if you happen to fail and fall back to a premade solution, you will still have learned something in the attempt.

<p>Ok great, so why black and orange? I chose the amber because it reminds me of an earlier time, back in the dark days of monochrome monitors. People often think of the green screen consoles when they think of the monitors from this time period, but there were also monochrome amber screens and this is what I had. When I think of my early involvement with computers, it is the black and amber that always comes to mind. Did you know that you can recreate these old green and amber consoles in the cmd prompt? Right click the title bar and hit properties.

<p>Anyway, stick around, discuss, enjoy, and I hope you find some interesting and useful content within my musings.
